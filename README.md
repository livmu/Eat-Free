Eat Free seeks to provide a more efficient way for corn-sensitive individuals to determine whether or not a product has corn. Users can input information on either: types of food products they are specifically interested (for browsing) or a UPC for a specific grocery product. Eat Free calculates a Corn Likely Level and provides detailed information on the ingredients.
